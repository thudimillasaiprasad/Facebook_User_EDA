Observations:
•	Observed that male user are high compared to female.
•	Female users has more friends than male users.
•	Female users has initiated more friend ships.
•	The distribution of tenure on the gender has positive ness so we can say that we have positive values with tenure days with the gender. They are using the platform for long time.
